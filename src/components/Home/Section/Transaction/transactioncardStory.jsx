              When it comes to global money transfers, every transaction becomes more than just a monetary exchange: It becomes an opportunity to strengthen connections and nurture ties with the people and places that have shaped us.

              And that is why global money transfers should offer the same seamless, cheap, and familiar experience as sending money within the same country, removing the mental gymnastics of how to get money across.
